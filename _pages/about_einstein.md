I am currently pursuing a Masterâ€™s degree in Robotics Engineering at Worcester Polytechnic Institute (WPI), where I am focused on developing innovative, end-to-end solutions that enable machines to intelligently perceive and interact with their environment. During my first semester, I took courses such as Motion Planning and Robot Control, where I gained hands-on experience in how robots plan and execute tasks, navigating through obstacles to achieve their goals effectively.

Before starting my graduate studies, I worked for two years at Jio, where I specialized in developing State of Charge (SoC) and State of Health (SoH) algorithms for Battery Management Systems (BMS). My work involved tackling complex challenges to improve the accuracy of both model-based and data-driven methods. During my time at Jio, I also developed custom Python scripts for Secure Renewable Energy Certificate (SREC) generation, facilitating firmware flashing to the bootloader. Additionally, I contributed to the design and development of firmware for an Electric Vehicle (EV) charger system, leveraging the OCPP (Open Charge Point Protocol) for seamless communication.


Write your biography here. Tell the world about yourself. Link to your favorite [subreddit](http://reddit.com). You can put a picture in, too. The code is already in, just name your picture `prof_pic.jpg` and put it in the `img/` folder.

Put your address / P.O. box / other info right below your picture. You can also disable any these elements by editing `profile` property of the YAML header of your `_pages/about.md`. Edit `_bibliography/papers.bib` and Jekyll will render your [publications page](/al-folio/publications/) automatically.

Link to your social media connections, too. This theme is set up to use [Font Awesome icons](https://fontawesome.com/) and [Academicons](https://jpswalsh.github.io/academicons/), like the ones below. Add your Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, Google Scholar, or just disable all of them.
