I am currently pursuing a Masterâ€™s degree in [Robotics Engineering](https://www.wpi.edu/academics/departments/robotics-engineering) at [Worcester Polytechnic Institute (WPI)](https://www.wpi.edu/), where I am focused on developing innovative, end-to-end solutions that enable machines to intelligently perceive and interact with their environment. During my first semester, I took courses such as [Motion Planning](https://wpi-grad.cleancatalog.net/robotics-engineering/rbe-550) and [Robot Control](https://wpi-grad.cleancatalog.net/robotics-engineering/rbe-502), where I gained hands-on experience in how robots plan and execute tasks, navigating through obstacles to achieve their goals effectively.

Before starting my graduate studies, I worked for two years at Jio Platforms Ltd., where I specialized in developing State of Charge (SoC) and State of Health (SoH) algorithms for Battery Management Systems (BMS). My work involved tackling complex challenges to improve the accuracy of both model-based and data-driven methods. During my time at Jio, I also developed custom Python scripts for Secure Renewable Energy Certificate (SREC) generation, facilitating firmware flashing to the bootloader. Additionally, I contributed to the design and development of firmware for an Electric Vehicle (EV) charger system, leveraging the [OCPP](https://openchargealliance.org/protocols/open-charge-point-protocol/) (Open Charge Point Protocol) for seamless communication.
